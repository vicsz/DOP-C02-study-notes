## Services In-Depth 
### **AWS CodeDeploy Study Sheet**
#### **1. Overview**
- **AWS CodeDeploy** automates the deployment of applications to a variety of targets, including:
  - **EC2 Instances**
  - **On-Premises Servers**
  - **Lambda Functions**
  - **Amazon ECS Services**

- **Deployment Models:**
  - **In-Place Deployments:** Deploys the new application version on existing instances.
  - **Blue/Green Deployments:** Spins up a new environment (green) and switches traffic over from the old environment (blue).

---

#### **2. Deployment Types**

| **Deployment Type** | **Description**                                                                                      | **Pros**                                              | **Cons**                                               |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **In-Place**        | Updates the existing instances with the new revision.                                                 | Simple, no new infrastructure needed.                 | Risk of downtime, possible inconsistencies.             |
| **Blue/Green**      | New instances are launched with the new revision and traffic is shifted to these instances when ready. | Zero downtime, easy rollback.                         | Higher cost, requires managing two environments.        |

---

#### **3. AppSpec File**
- **Definition:** The AppSpec file defines the deployment instructions and hooks for CodeDeploy.
- **Supported Formats:** YAML or JSON.
- **Location:** Must be located in the root directory of the application bundle (in S3, GitHub, etc.).
  
**Key Sections:**
  - **version:** Specifies the version of the AppSpec file.
  - **os:** The target operating system (`linux` or `windows`).
  - **files:** Describes the source and destination paths for files to be copied during deployment.
  - **hooks:** Defines lifecycle event hooks to run scripts or commands during the deployment.

---

#### **4. Lifecycle Hooks (EC2/On-Premises)**

| **Hook**                  | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ApplicationStop**        | Stops the currently running application before the deployment.                                    |
| **BeforeInstall**          | Pre-installation steps like taking backups or stopping services.                                  |
| **AfterInstall**           | Post-installation steps like configuring the environment or setting permissions.                  |
| **ApplicationStart**       | Starts the application after the new version is installed.                                        |
| **ValidateService**        | Verifies that the application is running correctly (e.g., smoke tests).                           |
| **BeforeAllowTraffic**     | Runs before traffic is routed to the new version, typically used for final checks or validations. |
| **AfterAllowTraffic**      | Runs after traffic is routed to the new version, used for cleanup or monitoring tasks.            |

---

#### **5. Rollbacks**
- CodeDeploy can automatically roll back to the previous revision if:
  - Deployment fails (e.g., lifecycle event script fails).
  - Instances fail health checks.
  - You configure **CloudWatch Alarms** to trigger a rollback.

---

#### **6. Deployment Configurations**
- **OneAtATime:** Deploys to one instance at a time.
- **HalfAtATime:** Deploys to 50% of instances at a time.
- **AllAtOnce:** Deploys to all instances at once (fast, but risky for production).

---

#### **7. CodeDeploy Agent**
- For **EC2/On-Premises Deployments**, CodeDeploy requires an agent running on the instance.
- The agent communicates with the CodeDeploy service and executes the deployment instructions as per the AppSpec file.
  
---

#### **8. Monitoring and Logging**
- **CloudWatch Logs:** Capture logs for each lifecycle event and deployment.
- **SNS Notifications:** Can notify via email/SMS if a deployment fails or succeeds.
- **CloudWatch Alarms:** Use alarms to trigger rollbacks or notifications based on deployment health metrics.

---

#### **9. Permissions (IAM)**
- Ensure that:
  - **CodeDeploy Service Role** has the correct permissions to interact with other AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda).
  - **EC2 Role** allows the instance to communicate with the CodeDeploy service (for pulling the deployment bundle, running scripts, etc.).

---

#### **10. Sample AppSpec File (YAML)**
```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /app/source/
    destination: /var/www/myapp
  - source: /config/settings.conf
    destination: /etc/myapp/settings.conf
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: scripts/stop_server.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
      timeout: 600
      runas: root
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/change_permissions.sh
      timeout: 600
      runas: root
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: scripts/start_server.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
  ValidateService:
    - location: scripts/validate_service.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

##### **Explanation:**
- **version:** Specifies the version of the AppSpec file (`0.0` is the required value).
- **os:** Specifies the operating system (in this case, `linux`).
- **files:** Specifies the source paths in the deployment bundle and the destination paths on the target instance.
  - **source:** Refers to a directory or file inside the build artifact (e.g., uploaded to S3).
  - **destination:** Specifies the path where the files should be copied on the target instance.
- **hooks:** Defines the deployment lifecycle event hooks and associated scripts.
  - Example: The `ApplicationStop` hook runs the `stop_server.sh` script before stopping the current version of the app.

---

#### **11. Common CodeDeploy Issues**
- **AppSpec File Errors:** Ensure proper syntax (YAML/JSON) and that paths and hooks are correct.
- **Agent Issues:** Ensure the CodeDeploy agent is installed and running on EC2/On-Premises instances.
- **Permission Errors:** Verify IAM roles are correctly assigned to CodeDeploy and EC2 instances.
- **Script Timeouts:** Make sure your lifecycle event scripts are correctly configured with reasonable timeouts.

### Deployment Methods

| **Method**             | **Description**                                                                 | **Advantages**                                               | **Challenges**                                                | **Use Cases**                                                 | **AWS Services** (related)                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deploy in Place**     | Deploys new code directly onto existing instances or infrastructure.             | Simple, no need for extra infrastructure.                     | Risk of downtime, inconsistent environments during deployment.  | Smaller applications with minimal traffic.                       | Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy (in-place)                          |
| **Rolling Deployment**  | Gradually replaces instances with new ones, while keeping some of the old ones running. | Minimizes downtime, supports graceful replacement.             | Complexity in managing partial deployments, slow rollout.        | Medium- to large-scale applications that need some availability during deployment. | CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk, Auto Scaling                        |
| **Immutable Deployment**| New instances are created with the new version of the application, and old instances are terminated after traffic is routed to the new ones. | Reduces risk of configuration drift, ensures consistency.      | Requires more infrastructure, higher cost.                      | Highly critical applications needing consistent environments.     | CodeDeploy (immutable), Auto Scaling, Elastic Beanstalk            |
| **Traffic Splitting**   | Diverts a small percentage of traffic to the new version before full rollout.    | Minimizes risk, allows testing with live traffic.              | Complex to implement and monitor, needs good rollback mechanisms. | Testing new features with minimal impact, A/B testing.            | AWS App Mesh, Lambda Traffic Shifting, API Gateway, CodeDeploy     |
| **Blue/Green Deployment**| Two separate environments (Blue and Green) are maintained. Traffic is switched to the new environment (Green) when ready. | Zero downtime, easy rollback.                                 | High infrastructure cost, complex environment management.       | Mission-critical systems needing zero downtime during deployment. | Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, Route 53, ELB, Auto Scaling         |

### Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategies

| **Strategy**           | **Description**                                                                 | **Advantages**                                                 | **Challenges**                                                 | **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** | **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** | **AWS Services** (related)                                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pilot Light**         | Core services run at minimal capacity in a second region, ready to scale in case of a disaster. | Lower cost than full replication, faster recovery than cold standby. | Must scale up during a disaster, still some downtime.           | Moderate                            | Moderate                            | EC2, RDS (Read Replica), Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling         |
| **Warm Standby**        | A scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running, ready to scale up when needed. | Faster recovery than Pilot Light, relatively low cost.          | Requires more resources than Pilot Light, but still some downtime. | Moderate                            | Faster than Pilot Light              | EC2, RDS, Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing                        |
| **Cold Standby**        | Backup is stored, but no active resources are running. The environment is spun up only after a disaster occurs. | Lowest cost.                                                   | Long recovery time, high risk of data loss.                      | High                                | High                                | S3, Glacier, EC2, CloudFormation                                      |
| **Hot Standby (Multi-Site)** | Full-scale version of your application is always running in another region, ready to take over instantly. | Near-instant failover, minimal downtime.                        | Highest cost, complex to maintain.                               | Very Low                            | Very Low                            | Route 53 (failover), EC2, RDS (multi-AZ), Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling |
| **Backup and Restore**  | Data is regularly backed up to a remote location, and infrastructure is spun up from scratch in the event of failure. | Simple and cost-effective.                                     | Slow recovery time, risk of data loss since backups may be infrequent. | High                                | High                                | S3, Glacier, CloudFormation, AWS Backup                               |
